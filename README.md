# ParametricSurvivalAnalysis
Thesis from AFIT

This thesis was completed and built in R/RStudio. A professor (Major Freels), along with the help of myself and a few other classmates, were able to build and validate packages within R that allowed for the formatting and necessary labels to be completed all within R. 

This work was designed to analyze when rated officers (pilots, etc.) are going to separate from the Air Force based on data like:
Sex, marital status, dependents, commissioning source, distinguished graduate, or prior service.

Used the AIC to measure how well some prababilistic models were able to fit the data, and came to the conclusion that the log-logistic did the best at modeling the prior retention rates.

Data is FOUO, but renderings of this data can be provided if necessary.
